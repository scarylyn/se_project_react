# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## WTWR is a Weather App that tells you what to wear

Just like it says up there, this is an app that will give you an idea of what to wear outdoors based on the current weather conditions. An API tracks your current longitude and latitude to HUNT YOU DOW-I mean, display the most accurate weather forecast based on your positioning!

You can test it out [right here.](https://scarylyn.github.io/se_project_react/)
