## WTWR is a Weather App that tells you what to wear

Just like it says up there, this is an app that will give you an idea of what to wear outdoors based on the current weather conditions. An API tracks your current longitude and latitude to HUNT YOU DOW-I mean, display the most accurate weather forecast based on your positioning!

You can test it out [right here.](https://scarylyn.github.io/se_project_react/)
I also made a demo video, check it out [here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZjfkyo9YDKrVmmcYue0u9_Lfbp7Yuoe/view?usp=sharing)
